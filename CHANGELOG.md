  > The climbing prefabs from VRTK.Prefabs have now been ported over into this newly named Tilia repo with some small reworks.

#### Bug Fixes

* **structure:** remove unrequired meta file for missing directory ([a3b003c](https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/Tilia.Locomotors.Climbing.Unity/commit/a3b003c993c3e8ff7f728edb78247f843b54d2da))
  > The NestedPrefabs directory isn't required so therefore was never committed, however the .meta file still was checked in which is incorrect so it has now been deleted.
